This is the capture of the home screen of the product developed by me at Ciena. The code for this product is not available is not supposed to be public. This product was developed in Angular 2 (Front End) and Java Springs (Business Logic) with PostgreSQL as the database. Data services were built in Java and Angular leveraged the REST APIs from that service to get the data. The idea was to move from a very old UI to a new smart UI with better performance (increased from 9 minutes to 13 seconds). The user can select the required columns to show out of multiple columns, drag the columns to change order, resize the columns, filter and sort the data through the fields, export the results to a CSV file. The user can also edit entries from the grid by just typing in a new value, however the POST and PUT methods were yet to be written during my tenure. The user can login and start from where the user left as the user preferences for the grid are saved.
